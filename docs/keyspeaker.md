### Using Mixed Precision in Numerical Computation

**Abstract** 

Low-precision floating-point arithmetic is a powerful   tool for accelerating scientific computing   applications, especially those in artificial intelligence.  Here, we present an investigation showing that other high-performance computing (HPC) applications can also harness this power.  Specifically, we use the general HPC problem, Ax=b, where A is a large dense matrix, and a double precision (FP64) solution is needed for accuracy. Our approach is based on mixed-precision (FP16 and FP64) iterative refinement, and we generalize and extend prior advances into a framework, for which we develop architecture-specific algorithms and highly tuned implementations. These new methods show how using half-precision Nvidia Tensor Cores (FP16-TC) for the arithmetic can provide up to 4Ã—speedup.  This is due to the performance boost that the FP16-TC provide as well as to the improved accuracy over the classical FP16 arithmetic that is obtained because the GEMM accumulation occurs in FP32 arithmetic.

### The Case for Edge Intelligence

**Abstract**

Applying machine learning to a range of problems in the real world---manufacturing, health care, agriculture---will require deploying ML well beyond the data center. Edge Intelligence is the confluence of machine learning and Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies.  Power, bandwidth, latency, and privacy all require that we perform tasks that require intelligence---detection, classification---at all levels of the IoT network from edge through fog to cloud.  This talk will start with a discussion of opportunities to apply machine learning to applications in the physical world and the technical challenges presented by those opportunities. The talk will then discuss two examples of machine learning systems that are embedded in the real world: communication systems adapted using Markov decision models (work with Shuvra Bhattacharyya); and real-time computer vision (work with Saibal Mukhopodhyay).
