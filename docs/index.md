<strong>
<p>
In light of the growing concerns regarding the Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic the HEART steering committee, program  chairs and general chair have decided to cancel and postpone the HEART symposium to 2021 in Paderborn.
</p>
<p>
An increasing number of institutions have already issued travel bans to high-risk areas and after the recent surge in infections in Germany, we are afraid that potential attendees of HEART may not be allowed to travel to Germany, or may face non-reimbursable cancellation cost if the symposium would have to be cancelled at a short notice.
</p>
<p>
We are are very sorry that we had to take this serious decision and sincerely apologize for any convenience this may cause but the health of our participants is our top priority.

# Overview and Venue

The International symposium on Highly Efficient Accelerators and Reconfigurable Technologies (HEART) is a forum to present and discuss new research on computing systems utilizing acceleration technology. The main theme of HEART is achieving high efficiency with accelerators, which is of utmost importance across a wide spectrum of computing systems. In the high performance computing and data center domains, high efficiency mostly relates to performance, while in the mobile and IoT space research communities think about accelerators more from a power/energy perspective.

The eleventh edition of HEART will take place in Paderborn, Germany. The event will start with pre-symposium Workshops and Tutorials on **June 17, 2020**. The symposium will be held **June 18 -19, 2020**.

The conference will be held at the [Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum](https://www.hnf.de/en/home.html) - the worlds largest computer museum. See [Venue](venue.md) for more information.
